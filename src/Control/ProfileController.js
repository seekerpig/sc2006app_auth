  //SO basically here, need to first useAuth from sessioncontroller and check whether if there is a currentUser
  //If no current User, then show alert or something

  //if there is currentUser, retrieve data from databasecontroller (need create a new function in databasecontroller.js to retrieve data based on id and collection)

  

  //this function is not yet implemented in profile page, so need to import into profile page also, cause profile page is currently hardcoded.
